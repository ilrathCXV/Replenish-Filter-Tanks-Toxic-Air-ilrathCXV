This mod adds some quality-of-life and user-experience additions to Drunk's Enhanced Toxic Air:
- Repair a filter by drag-and-dropping an identical filter onto the former - you will lose one of the filters in the process
  - If one of the filters is already at full condition, no filter will be lost if drag-and-dropped
- Consolidate the oxygen/condition between two identical oxygen tanks
  - If the two tanks combine to be over 100%, one tank will be fully repaired/filled while the remainder will put in the other tank
  - If the two tanks do not combine to over 100%, one tank will be lost in the process
  - If one of the tanks is already at full condition, no filter will be lost if drag-and-dropped
- Messages will be given to the player regarding equipping items:
  - If the player tries to repair non-identifcal filters
  - If the player tries to consolidate non-identical oxygen tanks
  - If the player equips a filter while having an oxygen tank equipped
  - If the player tries to equip an oxygen tank when either a filter is already equipped, the headgear is nor compatible, or no helmet is equipped
  - When a filter is equipped and no oxygen tanks are equipped
